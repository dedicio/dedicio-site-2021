# Dedicio Coelho Website

This is the project of my personal website.

I created this project to train developing with Next.js and styled-components.


## About the project

I used the default structure of Next.js and I only deleted the unused files.

I organized the components in the directory `components` and I created a `articlesResource.js` file to get my articles on Dev.to community.

There are two versions of the website, one in **Portuguese** and another in **English** _(using the page `en.js`)_


And that's it! It was fun to create this new simple website!
